# REST web APIs and Spring Boot

## Prerequisites
- A Spring Boot project set up with `Spring Web` dependency only.

## What is a REST API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It allows different software applications to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. 

REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process that request. They typically return data in JSON or XML format.

`JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most commonly used format for REST web APIs due to its simplicity and ease of use. An example of a JSON response might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Sample Post",
  "body": "This is a sample post content.",
  "userId": 1
}
```
An example of a REST API can be found at [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which provides fake online REST APIs for testing and prototyping.

We will create simple REST web APIs using Spring Boot, which you are already familiar with.

A REST API is designed around resources, which are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Each resource can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods:

- `GET`: Retrieve a resource or a collection of resources.
- `POST`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT`: Update an existing resource.
- `DELETE`: Remove a resource.

## Hello World REST API
Let's create a simple REST API that returns a greeting message.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/greetings")
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> getGreeting() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
In this example, we define a `GreetingController` class annotated with `@RestController`, which indicates that it is a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view. The `@RequestMapping` annotation specifies the base URI for all methods in this controller.

The `getGreeting` method is annotated with `@GetMapping`, which maps HTTP GET requests to this method. When a client sends a GET request to `/api/greetings`, it will receive a response with the message "Hello, World!" in the body.

To test this API, you can use tools like Postman or cURL. For example, using cURL, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/greetings
```
This should return the response:
```
Hello, World!
```

But this isn't a JSON response. To return a JSON response, we can modify the method to return a `Greeting` object:

```java
public class Greeting {
    private String message;
    
    public Greeting(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }
    // Getters and setters
}
```
Now, we can modify the `getGreeting` method to return a `Greeting` object:

```java
@GetMapping
public ResponseEntity<Greeting> getGreeting() {
    Greeting greeting = new Greeting("Hello, World!");
    return ResponseEntity.ok(greeting);
}
```
With this change, when you send a GET request to `/api/greetings`, the response will be in JSON format:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

Try calling the API from your browser (`http://localhost:8080/api/greetings`).

**Congratulations! You have created your first REST API using Spring Boot ðŸŽ‰**

## Serialization and Deserialization
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as JSON or XML. Deserialization is the reverse process, where the data is converted back into an object.
In Spring Boot, this is handled automatically by the Jackson library, which is included by default when you create a Spring Boot project with the `Spring Web` dependency.

When you return an object from a controller method, Spring Boot automatically serializes it to JSON. Similarly, when you send a JSON request body to a controller method, Spring Boot deserializes it into a Java object.

## Returning a more complex object
Let's create a more complex object to return from our API. We will create a `Person` and an `Address` class, and return a `Person` object that contains an `Address`.

```java
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String zipCode;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private Address address;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```
Now, let's create a new controller to return a `Person` object with an `Address`:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/persons")
public class PersonController {
    
    private List<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();

    public PersonController() {
        Address address = new Address("Guldbergsgade 29", "Copenhagen", "2300");
        Person person = new Person("Osman", 33, address);
        persons.add(person);
    }

    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<Person>> getPersons() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(persons);
    }
}
```
The `PersonController` class that handles requests to `/api/persons`. The `getPersons` method is mapped to GET requests and returns a list of `Person` objects as a JSON response.

Test this API using the browser or cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/persons
```
You should receive a response like this:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Osman",
        "age": 33,
        "address": {
            "street": "Guldbergsgade 29",
            "city": "Copenhagen",
            "zipCode": "2300"
        }
    }
]
```

## Status Codes
When building REST APIs, it's important to return appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the result of the request. Here are some common status codes:
- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `201 Created`: A new resource was successfully created.
- `204 No Content`: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or cannot be processed.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server.

This is the reason why we use `ResponseEntity` in our controller methods, as it allows us to control the status code along with the response body. The status codes can be set using the `ResponseEntity` methods like `ok()`, `status()`, `noContent()`, `badRequest()`, `notFound()`, and `internalServerError()`.

```java
// Status code 200 OK
return ResponseEntity.ok(persons);
// Status code 201 Created
return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(newPerson);
// Status code 204 No Content
return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
// Status code 400 Bad Request
return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body("Invalid request");
// Status code 404 Not Found
return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
// Status code 500 Internal Server Error
return ResponseEntity.internalServerError().build();
```

## Exercise
1. Create a new REST API that returns the following JSON response:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Java for dummies",
        "author": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "age": 45
        },
        "tags": ["Java", "Programming", "Education"]
    }
]
```
**Hint:** Create classes for `Book`, `Author`, and use a `List<String>` for tags. Implement a controller (`BookController`) that returns a list of `Book` objects. Create several `Book` objects in the controller constructor to return a list of books.
